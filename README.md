# Tokenized Intellectual Property Patent Portfolio Management

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing intellectual property patent portfolios through tokenization and smart contract automation on the Stacks blockchain.

## System Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to provide a complete IP management solution:

### Core Contracts

#### 1. IP Attorney Verification (`ip-attorney-verification.clar`)
- Validates intellectual property attorney credentials
- Manages attorney registration and status
- Provides verification services for legal operations

#### 2. Patent Filing Contract (`patent-filing.clar`)
- Manages patent application filing processes
- Tracks application status and milestones
- Handles fee payments and documentation

#### 3. Portfolio Optimization Contract (`portfolio-optimization.clar`)
- Optimizes patent portfolio allocation
- Provides analytics and recommendations
- Manages portfolio rebalancing strategies

#### 4. Licensing Coordination Contract (`licensing-coordination.clar`)
- Coordinates patent licensing agreements
- Manages royalty distributions
- Handles licensing terms and conditions

#### 5. Infringement Monitoring Contract (`infringement-monitoring.clar`)
- Monitors patent infringement cases
- Tracks violation reports and resolutions
- Manages enforcement actions

## Key Features

### Tokenization
- Patents represented as blockchain tokens
- Fractional ownership capabilities
- Transparent ownership tracking
- Automated transfer mechanisms

### Automation
- Smart contract-based workflows
- Automated compliance checking

- External API compatibility

## Contract Interactions

The contracts interact through a well-defined interface system:

1. **Attorney Verification** validates legal representatives
2. **Patent Filing** processes applications with verified attorneys
3. **Portfolio Optimization** analyzes filed patents
4. **Licensing Coordination** manages approved patent licensing
5. **Infringement Monitoring** protects portfolio assets

## Deployment

Deploy contracts in the following order:
1. ip-attorney-verification.clar
2. patent-filing.clar
3. portfolio-optimization.clar
4. licensing-coordination.clar
5. infringement-monitoring.clar

## Usage Examples

### Register an Attorney
```clarity
(contract-call? .ip-attorney-verification register-attorney 
  "John Doe" 
  "Patent Attorney" 
  "BAR123456")
